# A note on Notes

These are all one-off notes. I typically write to aid in-the-moment retention, _not_ for long-term reference. Thus, **~none** of this makes for a good summary of the underlying material. Frequently the stuff I note is just the bits I found particularly difficult, or resonant with some other recent thing I learned.

Also - this mainly exists so I can take notes from anywhere. It's public because public is free - but also, there's no reason for it not to be. If you come across this and would like to update or expound on anything, I'll happily accept pull requests. ðŸ˜‡

Also of note - clearly very many docs here started as plaintext and are now markdown. So they're frequently terribly formatted. Sorry!
