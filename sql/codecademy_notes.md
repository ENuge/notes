# Codecademy SQL Track

`JOIN` - will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.

`LEFT JOIN` - will return every row in the _left_ table, and if the join condition is not met, `NULL` values for all the right table columns.

_Foreign key_ is a column that contains the primary key to another table.

`CROSS JOIN` lets us combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.

`UNION` stacks one dataset on top of another.

`WITH` allows us to define one or more temporary tables that can be used in the final query.
